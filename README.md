# Instapet

Instapet is an Instagram clone app developed in ECS165A (Database Systems) - Winter 19. Users can post and like photos, follow people, and so on just like Instagram. However, in order to make our app a bit more unique, we decided to create a platform which can foster a community of pet lovers and help users discover resources that they can depend on.

Instapet was created with React Native and Google Firestore. This quarter long project was divided into 4 milestones, each adding extra features to both frontend and backend. More info about each milestone below.
